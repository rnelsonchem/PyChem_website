Examples
========

The following sections are real world data plotting, analysis, and simulation
examples. Each section will highlight a new set of skills and build off of
information from the last. If you are new, it may be best to move through
these one at a time. They will also become progressively more complex, so by
the end, you should have a fairly strong foundation in the material.
