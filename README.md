# PyChem Website

This is a small introductory website meant to get people up and running using
Python for scientific problems (specifically, chemistry related).

You can build this site yourself if you have Sphinx installed; however, a
pre-built version is also being hosted on (GitHub
Pages)[http://rnelsonchem.github.io/PyChem_website/].
