Is this really hard?
====================

The 'simple' answer to that question is 'It will be as hard as you make it.'
But that's not really satisfactory, is it?

A Quick Example
---------------

As another way to answer that question, let's take a look at some real world
data, and a simple Python analysis program. These data are a collection of
crystallographically measured metal oxygen distances between 1.2 and 2.6 Ã…
saved as a comma separated value (csv) text file. The ultimate goal is to make
a histogram of these values, so that we can determine the average (and
extreme) distances for different metal oxygen bond types.

Below are the first ten lines of the :download:`data file<./MO.csv>`: the
full file is over 43,000 lines of *unsorted* bond distances.

.. literalinclude:: MO.csv
    :language: text
    :linenos: 
    :lines: 1-10 

A Python program that analyzes these data and its graphical output are shown
below. We were able to accomplish our goal in 5 lines of code.  *Note*: The
plot shown here is not the exact output of this program. If you were to run
this as a standalone program, the plot would open in an interactive window,
with support for panning, zooming, saving, etc. (Don't worry if the commands
don't make sense.  That's the point of reading this document!)

.. plot:: ./quick/MO.py
    :include-source:

There. That wasn't so bad, was it? If this seems like something you'd like to
learn, then keep reading.

*BONUS*: Looking at this plot, approximate the average bond distances
for manganese oxygen single and double bonds?

Publication Quality Plot
------------------------

With some modifications, our simple plot can be made publication-ready as
shown below.

.. plot:: ./quick/MO_pub.py
